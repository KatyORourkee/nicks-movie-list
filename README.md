# nicks-movie-list
My husband finally cancelled his Netflix DVD subscription that he's had for years and years. Now that it's gone, he misses a decision-free way of getting a new movie to watch. This app is meant to take a list of movies to watch and suggest one, forcing him to watch that one before a new one can be suggested. Trust me, he will like it!
